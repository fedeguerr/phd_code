# phd_code

Some of the Python code I developed during my Ph.D. for running simulations of microplastic and plastic-related pollution in the Mediterranean Sea (see https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hRox2jkAAAAJ&hl=it&authuser=1 for a list of my published works).

The list of published scripts is, of course, not exaustive of those produced during my Ph.D. research: I reserve the right not to share some parts of it (being part of publications in prep or of ongoing further development in my research group).
